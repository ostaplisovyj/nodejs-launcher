## About this project
*nodejs-launcher* is a CLI tool written in Rust aimed to simplify launching NodeJS scripts with specified environment variables through command line (bash, powershell, etc.). 

## Why?
I've used VScode for most of my development tasks for years and I loved using debug configurations to put my ENV variables in .vscode/launch.json and reuse them between debug sessions. 
After moving my workflow primarily to neoVIM I miss the debug configurations and laucnhing my NodeJS script becomes tedious. 
For now this tool will replicate the role of vscode *launch.json* with easy to use CLI commands.
