## About this project
*nodejs-launcher* is a CLI tool written in Rust which enables launch configurations for NodeJS applications.

## Why?
Common IDEs (VScode, Webstorm etc.) have built-in debuggers which extensively take advantage of launch configurations. This espesially comes handy when there's a lot of environment variables to pass to a NodeJS script. 

In case you don't use an IDE or prefer a lightweight alternative (like a terminal editor, i.e. `vim`, `emacs`, `nano`) having launch configurations can save a lot of time. This tool solves exactly this problem. The launch configuration is similar to VScode's built-in debugger configuration (`launch.json`)
